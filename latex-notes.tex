\chapter{Notes on the \LaTeX\ version}

\emph{Forest Vines To Snow Tussocks} has been sadly out of print for some years.
Fortunately, Victoria University of Wellington has made it available in their New Zealand Electronic Text Collection (\url{https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/}), under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 NZ license (\url{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/}).

In 2021, I, Doug Rinckes, prepared this \LaTeX\ version. The source is available (under the same license) at \url{https://github.com/drinckes/forestvinestosnowtussocks}.

Deviations from the original book are minor, largely limited to correcting errors made in previous conversions.

The book is set in 11pt EB Garamond, with Biolinum for chapter and section headings.
